# Introduction 
Using the English translation files for the Japanese version of the game would give you a lot a missing translations, but no more!
Now I got fixed English translations for you to use in the Japanese version. The translations of both current builds, JTOS and ITOS, got programmatically mapped by comparing their Korean translations.

# Installation
Move the `English` folder in the games `languageData` folder.

Your games folder path should then look something like this:
```
../Steam/steamapps/common/Tree of Savior (Japanese Ver.)/release/languageData/English
```
That's it, you're ready to go!

# Contribute
If you find any mistakes or missing translations that are available in the English version or you know the translation of, open up an issue or a pull request!
