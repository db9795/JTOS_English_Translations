# Introduction 
Using the English translation files for the Japanese version of the game would give you a lot a missing translations, but no more!
Now I got fixed English translations for you to use in the Japanese version. The translations of both current builds, JTOS and ITOS, got programmatically mapped by comparing their Korean translations.

# Installation
Create a folder called `English` in the games `languageData` folder.

Your folder path should look something like this:
```
../Steam/steamapps/common/Tree of Savior (Japanese Ver.)/release/languageData/English/
```
Now copy all `.tsv` translation files and the `font` folder into your `English` folder.
That's it, you're ready to go!

# Contribute
If you find any mistakes or missing translations that are available in the English version or you can translate yourself, please open up an issue!
